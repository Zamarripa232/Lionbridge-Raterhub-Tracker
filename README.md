# Lionbridge-Raterhub-Tracker

Lionbridge requires some pretty meticulous timekeeping for their contracted workers, at least on the Raterhub related projects. This tries to make it less of a hassle.

It does this by:

* Running in the background as you work.
* Keeping an eye out for mouse input or keyboard input to start/stop timers.
* Tracks actual time spent working *and* AET.
* Saves all of this in a handy .xlsx.
