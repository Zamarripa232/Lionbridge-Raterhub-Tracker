# Lionbridge-Raterhub-Tracker
Lionbridge requires some pretty meticulous timekeeping for their contracted workers, at least on the Raterhub related projects. This tries to make it less of a hassle.

It does this by:

* Running in the background as you work.
* Keeping an eye out for mouse input or keyboard input to start/stop timers.
* Tracks actual time spent working *and* AET.
* Saves all of this in a handy .xlsx.

## Author
* Floydasaurus, the dinosaur.

# How to Contribute
You could fork a copy, make changes and submit a pull request. I'm not going to try and stop you.

I'd also appreciate any issues or bug submissions.

Honestly, you'd know better than me I'm just a dinosaur.
